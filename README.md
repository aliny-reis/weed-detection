# Weed Detection from UAV Images
This project focuses on detecting weeds in a crop field using data from UAV (drone) images.
The main idea is to classify each pixel in the image into three classes:

- **Bare soil**
- **Crop**
- **Weeds**

Two different approaches were tested: a Neural Network and a Random Forest algorithm.
Both methods aim to identify patterns in the image that help separate weeds from crops and soil.
